This document is a report containing CNN (Machine Learning) models used to identify whether an individual's RX is normal or has signs of either Pneumonia or Covid-19.
I'll start by using simple models and then I'll combine them with larger models through Transfer Learning.

The dataset contains:
Total RX: 3886
Covid-19: 1200
Normal: 1341
Pneumonia: 1345

20% of these are used as test data. Respectively: COVID 240, NORMAL 269, PNEUMONIA 269.
